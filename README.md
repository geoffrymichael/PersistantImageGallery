# PersistentImageGallery

Created as an assignment for Stanfordâ€™s p193 Introduction to iPhone Development course. This is a basic image gallery that allows a user to drag and drop images from the web (on ipads using multi-tasking) into the app and be stored. Among other things, this project uses drag and drop delegates, scrollview, the UIdocument api and multi-threading and asynchronous functions. This project is in the fine-tuning and bug fixing stages.
